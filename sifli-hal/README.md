- ❓ : Requires demo verification
- `+` : Async support
- N/A : Not available

## Features

- `defmt` or `log`: Debug log output.

  TODO: Currently, `probe-rs` does not support `sf32`. I tried using `defmt` with Segger RTT but couldn't see the log output.

- `sf32lb52x`: Target chip selection. Currently, only `sf32lb52x` is supported.

- `set-msplim`: Set the MSPLIM register in `__pre_init`. This register must be set before the main function’s stack setup (since the bootloader may have already configured it to a different value), otherwise, it will cause a HardFault.

- `time-driver-xxx`: Timer configuration for `time-driver`. It requires at least two capture/compare channels. For the `sf32lb52x hcpu`, only `atim1`(TODO), `gptim1`, and `gptim2` are available.

- `unchecked-overclocking`: Enable this feature to disable the overclocking check. DO NOT ENABLE THIS FEATURE UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
